# Updated NppTaskList
A modification of the [original](https://github.com/Megabyteceer/npp-task-list) NppTaskList plugin that automatically hides the task list when there aren't any _TODO:_ items in the file. I'd do like a pull request or something but [I don't know how GitHub works](https://xkcd.com/1597/) and the code is probably bad anyway so I'm just saving it here.

## Note:
Visual Studio 2013 is needed to compile.
