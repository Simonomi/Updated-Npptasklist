# Updated NppTaskList
I changed the [original](https://github.com/Megabyteceer/npp-task-list) NppTaskList plugin to automatically hide the task list when there aren't any _TODO:_ items in the file. I'd do like a pull request or something but [I don't know how GitHub works](https://xkcd.com/1597/) and the code is really bad anyway so I'm just saving it here.

## Note:
To compile you will need Visual Studio 2013.
